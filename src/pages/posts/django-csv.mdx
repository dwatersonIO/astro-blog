description: Its common to have data from another source in csv format that you want to process with Django. But perhaps you do not want all the columns.

## Create the Django Model

```python
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

# Create your models here.

class TeamDict(models.Model):
    expression = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    translation = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    definition = models.TextField()
```

## Use a Management Command

Make folder /management/commands/populate_database.py

```python
import csv
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.conf import settings
from pages.models import TeamDict

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Load data from csv file'

    def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Clear db
        if TeamDict.objects.count()>0:
            TeamDict.objects.all().delete()
        
        DATA_FILE = settings.BASE_DIR / 'data' / 'dict.csv'
        assert DATA_FILE.exists()

        with open(DATA_FILE, 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
            db_rows = []
            for row in reader:
                db_rows.append(TeamDict(
                    expression=row['expression'],
                    translation=row['translation'],
                    definition=row['definition']
                ))
            TeamDict.objects.bulk_create(db_rows,batch_size=1000)
        
```

## Run the managment command

```bash
python manage.py populate_database.py
```

## Check the entries from the Django shell

```python
python manage.py shell
from .models import TeamDict
TeamDict.objects.count()
```
This will tell you number of entries in the db so you can verify all the records were imported as expected.
