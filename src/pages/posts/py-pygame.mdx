## Setup

```py
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/path.. .csv', index_col='email')
```
Note: index_col if you want to change default index when importing

## Surfaces

There is one main surfaces that all other regular surfaces are then attached to. 
The three regular surfaces are:

1. Font text
2. Imported images
3. Colours

## Rectangles

There are two reasons
- Help with precise positioning
- Allows collision detection
