In our example we will use a form to process a data query or search. The simplest way to to use a basic HTML form as shown below. The `name` attribute is important since it will be references in our Django view

## First Way: Use a simple HTML form
```html
<!-- template -->
<input  type="search" placeholder="Search notes..." name="searched">
<button type="submit">Search</button> 
```
Then setup your logic in the `views.py` form

```python
# views.py
if request.method == "POST":
    searched = request.POST['searched'] # searched is the name attribute of the HTML form
    # In this example we will filter the Note.text database field for the search text
    notes = Note.objects.filter(text__contains=searched)
    return render(request, 'notes/search_note.html', {"searched":searched, "notes": notes})
```


## Second and Better Way

Use the Django form functionality to refer to the form in the template and then submit the data to the backend. This option does not depend on using the `name` attribute.
```python
# template
<form method="post" name="search_text" action="{% url 'search_note' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.text }}
    {{ form.type }}
    <button type="submit">Search</button> 
</form>
```
Then setup the logic to process the form. 

```python
# views.py
def search_note(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form=NoteForm(request.POST) # create an instance of the form sent
        if form.is_valid():
            searched=form.cleaned_data["text"]
            notes = Note.objects.filter(text__contains=searched)	

    else: # if this was a GET request then load empty form and send all data to the template
        notes = Note.objects.all().order_by('-date_created')
        form=NoteForm()

return render(request, 'notes/search_note.html', {"form": form, "notes": notes})
```
